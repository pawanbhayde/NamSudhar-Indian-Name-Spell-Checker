The Levenshtein distance, also known as the edit distance, is a measure of the similarity between two strings. It is defined as the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

For example, the Levenshtein distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3, as you can transform "kitten" into "sitting" by substituting 'k' with 's', substituting 'i' with 'i', and adding 'g' at the end.
